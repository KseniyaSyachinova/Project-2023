# My review 

The work of Three Comrades is one of the most beloved novels of all readers of Remark.The book catches with its simplicity in writing and deep meaning.

The novel takes place in post-war Germany.Three best friends:Lenz, Kester, Locamp.They went through the whole war together and managed to preserve their former friendship.In the work, you can single out the main character - this is Robbie Lockamp, in fact, he tells the whole story.By the way, the main love line is connected with him.Careful, spoiler alert! The book very often contains passages where the main character reasons and analyzes his decisions and actions, from a psychological point of view, such a format of writing attracts the reader's attention and makes you think about similar questions that the Locamp will ask.

The beautiful half, who will have to read this masterpiece, will undoubtedly like the love line, which is almost the main one in the plot.With the most vivid epithets and verbal phrases, Remark describes the feelings that lovers experience.

If you are wondering whether it is worth reading this work or not, in my opinion I will definitely say that everyone should read IT, especially avid lovers of Remark, you will fall in love, as I once did
