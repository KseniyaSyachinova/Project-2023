## My impressions.


Gravity Falls is an American animated television series created by Alex Hirsch and Disney Television Animation for the Disney Channel and Disney XD TV channels.

The animated series tells about the adventures of twins — a boy Dipper and a girl Mabel, who spend their summer holidays with great-uncle Stan in a fictional American town called Gravity Falls.

It premiered on June 15, 2012 on the Disney Channel. On June 14, 2014, it was announced that the second season would premiere on August 1 and 4, 2014 on Disney Channel and Disney XD, respectively. On November 20, 2015, Alex Hirsch announced that the series would end on the second season. The last episode of the second season, titled "Strangeddon 3: Bring Back Gravity Falls", was broadcast on February 15, 2016. On Twitter, the creator of the animated series Alex Hirsch announced an addition to the series in the form of a comic book.

The main characters

  - Dipper Pines is a 12—year-old boy, Mabel's twin brother, who came to Gravity Falls for summer vacation. Always wears a cap. I came to Gravity Falls for the summer and found a mysterious diary there. He dreams of finding the author of the diaries. In love with Wendy.
  - Mabel Pines is a 12—year-old girl, Dipper's twin sister. Kind and cheerful. He loves his piggy Plump. Wears various sweaters.
  - Stanley "Uncle Stan" Pines is Dipper and Mabel's great—uncle, whom they call Uncle. The owner of the "Hut of Wonders".
  - Zus Ramirez is a 22—year-old master and permanent employee of the "Hut of Miracles"; a good friend of Dipper and Mabel. Likes to eat delicious food. Fact: in the Russian dubbing, the name of Sous was renamed to Sous, indicating godlike.
  - Wendy Cordroy is a 15—year-old red-haired girl, an employee of the "Hut of Miracles". The object of Dipper's infatuation.
  - Stanford Pines is the missing twin brother of Stanley Pines, the great-uncle of Dipper and Mabel. Scientist and author of diaries.
  - Bill Cipher is an ancient powerful demon from another plane of existence, who wants to penetrate the world of people. The main antagonist of the series.
  
  Gravity Falls is the quintessence of mysticism, humor, friendship and adventure! I can watch this series many times, because every time it's interesting and fun again. The family also adds its own note to the series, which makes it even warmer. Uncle Stan is such a convex image, when I see him, I immediately remember my own father. Perhaps this is due to the attitude to everything and the desire to earn. One goal, so to speak. At the same time, the series unobtrusively broadcasts family values, support and love.
