## Полезная информация.

## Useful information.

- I recently got acquainted with the Markdown markup language. I want to share with you information that may be useful to you.
Markdown is a simple markup language used to create formatted text (such as HTML) using a text editor. It allows you to add basic formatting to the text using characters known and available on all keyboards. Font size, color, and other advanced options are not available in Markdown.

## Why is it needed?
- To add markup to places where real markup is not possible. For example, in a simple text file or in the same SMS, where it is impossible to highlight bold, create titles, highlight quotes, etc.
- For more convenient writing of texts for subsequent conversion to HTML or other formats.

The syntax of this language can be found at the link: [**Introduction to the syntax of the language**](https://guides.hexlet.io/ru/markdown
